# SSH and Telnet Labs

## Purpose
In this set of labs, I focused on configuring secure and insecure remote access methods. My goal was to understand why SSH is preferred and how to properly secure administrative access.

## Topology Overview
These labs use a simple router and switch setup to highlight remote access behavior, authentication, and encryption.

## Key Configurations
- Enabling SSH version 2
- Generating RSA keys
- Restricting VTY access to SSH only
- Configuring local user authentication
- Comparing SSH and Telnet behavior

## Troubleshooting Notes
I verified that SSH sessions were encrypted, confirmed that Telnet was disabled, and ensured that authentication worked consistently across all VTY lines.
