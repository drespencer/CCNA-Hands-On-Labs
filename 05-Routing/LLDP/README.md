# LLDP Lab

## Purpose
In this lab, I practiced using LLDP to discover neighboring devices in a vendor‑neutral environment. My goal was to understand how LLDP supports multi‑vendor networks.

## Topology Overview
This lab uses switches and routers connected through Ethernet links to demonstrate LLDP neighbor discovery.

## Key Configurations
- Enabling LLDP globally and per interface
- Viewing LLDP neighbor details
- Comparing LLDP output to CDP

## Verification Commands
show lldp neighbors  
show lldp neighbors detail  
show lldp interface  

## Troubleshooting Notes
I confirmed that LLDP timers and settings were consistent and validated that neighbor information matched the expected topology.
