# Projects

## Purpose
This folder contains larger, multi-technology projects that combine routing, switching, security, and WAN concepts. My goal is to design and troubleshoot complete network environments that reflect real-world scenarios.

## Topology Overview
These projects use multi-router and multi-switch topologies designed to test end-to-end connectivity, redundancy, and service integration.

## Key Configurations
- Multi-protocol routing
- VLAN and trunking design
- Redundancy and failover
- WAN connectivity and tunneling
- Security enforcement across the network

## Troubleshooting Notes
I validated full-path connectivity, checked for routing inconsistencies, confirmed redundancy behavior, and ensured that all services operated as expected across the entire topology.
