# CCNA Hands-On Networking Labs

## Purpose
This repository is my complete collection of CCNA-level hands-on labs. I built these labs to strengthen my operational networking skills, practice real device configurations, and document the troubleshooting process behind each scenario. My goal is to demonstrate practical experience with routing, switching, WAN technologies, and network security in a way that reflects real-world environments.

## Repository Overview
The labs in this repository are organized by topic, with each folder containing Packet Tracer files and a README that explains the purpose, topology, key configurations, verification steps, and troubleshooting notes for that specific lab.

The structure is designed to make it easy to navigate, study, and revisit concepts as needed.

## What These Labs Cover
- Foundational router and switch configuration
- VLANs, trunking, and inter-VLAN routing
- Dynamic routing protocols (OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, BGP)
- Static and default routing
- WAN technologies including PPP and GRE
- Network security with ACLs and port security
- Redundancy and failover (HSRP, EtherChannel, STP)
- Network services such as DHCP, DNS, NTP, and Syslog
- End-to-end multi-technology projects

## How to Use This Repository
1. Install Cisco Packet Tracer (version 8.x recommended).
2. Clone or download this repository:
3. Open any folder and load the `.pkt` file in Packet Tracer.
4. Review the README.md inside each folder to understand:
- The purpose of the lab  
- The topology being used  
- Key configurations  
- Verification commands  
- Troubleshooting notes  
5. Use the labs to study, practice, or prepare for CCNA-level roles.

## Why I Built This
These labs represent my approach to learning: hands-on, methodical, and focused on operational clarity. Every configuration, verification step, and troubleshooting note reflects real practice and real understanding not just theory.

This repository also serves as a portfolio of my technical abilities, showing how I design, configure, validate, and document networks.

## Future Additions
I plan to continue expanding this repository with:
- More advanced routing and switching scenarios  
- Additional WAN and security labs  
- Larger multi-site project builds
