# InterVLAN Routing Labs

## Purpose
In this lab set, I focused on enabling communication between VLANs using Router-on-a-Stick and Layer 3 switching. My goal was to understand how routing integrates with VLAN segmentation.

## Topology Overview
These labs use a combination of routers and multilayer switches to demonstrate subinterfaces, SVIs, and inter-VLAN routing behavior.

## Key Configurations
- Creating subinterfaces for Router-on-a-Stick
- Assigning IP addresses to SVIs
- Enabling routing on multilayer switches
- Testing communication between VLANs

## Troubleshooting Notes
I confirmed that trunk links were configured correctly, validated SVI status, and ensured that routing tables reflected the expected inter-VLAN paths.
