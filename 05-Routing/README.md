# Routing Protocol and Layer 3 Services Labs

## Purpose
In this set of labs, I focused on building and validating routing across multiple protocols and services. My goal was to understand how routers exchange routes, provide redundancy, and support essential network services.

## Topology Overview
These labs use multi-router topologies designed to highlight dynamic routing behavior, failover, and Layer 3 services such as NAT, DHCP, DNS, NTP, and Syslog.

## Key Configurations
- Configuring OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, and BGP
- Building static and default routes
- Implementing HSRP for gateway redundancy
- Setting up NAT overload and static translations
- Deploying DHCP pools and relay
- Configuring DNS, NTP, and Syslog services

## Troubleshooting Notes
I validated neighbor adjacencies, checked routing table accuracy, confirmed HSRP failover behavior, and ensured that Layer 3 services operated consistently across the network.
