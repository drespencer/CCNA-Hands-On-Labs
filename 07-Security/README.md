# Network Security Labs

## Purpose
In this set of labs, I focused on securing both Layer 2 and Layer 3 environments. My goal was to apply access control, endpoint protection, and interface-level security.

## Topology Overview
These labs use switch and router topologies designed to highlight ACL behavior, port security enforcement, and traffic filtering.

## Key Configurations
- Creating and applying standard and extended ACLs
- Restricting traffic on specific interfaces
- Enforcing port security limits and violation actions
- Validating access control behavior

## Troubleshooting Notes
I confirmed ACL placement and direction, validated port security violations, and ensured that legitimate traffic flowed while unauthorized traffic was blocked.
