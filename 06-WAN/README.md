# WAN Technology Labs

## Purpose
In this set of labs, I focused on WAN encapsulation, authentication, and tunneling. My goal was to understand how remote sites connect securely over service provider networks.

## Topology Overview
These labs use point-to-point router connections and tunnel interfaces to demonstrate PPP authentication and GRE tunneling.

## Key Configurations
- Configuring PPP with PAP and CHAP
- Verifying encapsulation and keepalives
- Building GRE tunnels between routers
- Testing end-to-end connectivity through tunnels

## Troubleshooting Notes
I validated PPP authentication, confirmed tunnel status, and ensured that routed traffic successfully traversed the GRE tunnel.
