# VLAN Lab

## Purpose
In this lab, I focused on creating VLANs, assigning switchports, and understanding how segmentation improves network organization and security. My goal was to build a strong foundation in Layer 2 separation and traffic isolation.

## Topology Overview
This lab uses a simple multi-switch environment to demonstrate VLAN creation, access port assignment, and trunk behavior.

## Key Configurations
- Creating VLANs and naming them
- Assigning access ports to specific VLANs
- Verifying VLAN membership across switches
- Testing communication between devices in the same and different VLANs

## Troubleshooting Notes
I validated that devices in the same VLAN could communicate and confirmed isolation between different VLANs. I also checked trunk links to ensure VLANs were allowed and propagated correctly.
