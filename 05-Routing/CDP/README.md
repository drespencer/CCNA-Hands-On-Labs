# CDP Lab

## Purpose
In this lab, I focused on using CDP to discover directly connected Cisco devices. My goal was to understand how CDP helps with topology mapping and troubleshooting.

## Topology Overview
This lab uses multiple Cisco devices connected through Ethernet links to demonstrate CDP neighbor discovery.

## Key Configurations
- Enabling or disabling CDP globally and per interface
- Viewing neighbor information
- Validating device roles and connections

## Verification Commands
show cdp neighbors  
show cdp neighbors detail  
show cdp interface  

## Troubleshooting Notes
I verified that CDP was enabled on the correct interfaces and confirmed that neighbor information matched the physical topology.
