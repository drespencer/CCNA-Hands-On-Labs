# NTP Lab

## Purpose
In this lab, I focused on configuring NTP to synchronize device clocks. My goal was to understand how accurate time supports logging, security, and troubleshooting.

## Topology Overview
This lab uses a router acting as an NTP server or client to demonstrate time synchronization.

## Key Configurations
- Setting NTP servers
- Configuring authentication (if used)
- Verifying time synchronization
- Checking clock drift

## Verification Commands
show ntp status  
show ntp associations  
show clock  

## Troubleshooting Notes
I validated that the device synchronized with the correct server and checked for reachability issues or authentication mismatches.
