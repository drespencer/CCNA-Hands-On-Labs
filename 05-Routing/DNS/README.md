# DNS Lab

## Purpose
In this lab, I practiced configuring basic DNS services. My goal was to understand how routers resolve hostnames and how DNS servers support client lookups.

## Topology Overview
This lab uses a router or server acting as a DNS resolver for connected devices.

## Key Configurations
- Setting DNS server addresses
- Creating local host entries
- Testing name resolution from clients
- Verifying DNS behavior in routing scenarios

## Verification Commands
show hosts  
show running-config  
ping <hostname>  

## Troubleshooting Notes
I confirmed that DNS servers were reachable, validated hostname resolution, and checked for incorrect or missing host entries.
